Tokoyo: City of Ashes Source Code

This is the source code for my current personal project "Tokyo: City of Ashes". 

The project utilises Unreal Engine's ability system for actions such as the camp building and the PDA. 

The project has also fully migrated to using the enhanced input. The project takes advantage of this to switch on and off building controls when camp building.

This repository is code only. It's to be used as a reference and for learning purposes.
